            <p class="sectionTag text-big">Introduction to C/C++</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The C language was developed in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Telephone
                laboratories, primarily as a systems programming language (a language to write operating systems with).
                Many previous operating systems had been written in assembly. Unlike assembly, which produces programs
                that can only run on specific CPUs, C has excellent portability, allowing Unix to be easily recompiled
                on many different types of computers and speeding its adoption. C and Unix had their fortunes tied
                together, and C's popularity was in part tied to the success of Unix as an operating system.
                <br><br><br>
                The C++ language was developed in 1985 by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs as an extension to C, starting
                in 1979. C++ adds many new features to the C language, and is perhaps best thought of as a superset of
                C, though this is not strictly true (as C99 introduced a few features that do not exist in C++). C++'s
                claim to fame results primarily from the fact that it is an object-oriented language. As for what an
                “object” is and how it differs from traditional programming methods, well, we'll cover that in later
                chapters.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Java was developed in 1995 by James Gosling. Java is a class-based,
                object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as
                possible. It is intended to let application developers write once, and run anywhere (WORA), meaning that
                compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.
                <br><br> Java is widely used for developing applications for desktop, web, and mobile devices. Java is
                known for its simplicity, robustness, and security features, making it a popular choice for
                enterprise-level applications. It helps to create reusable code and modular programs. <br><br> Java is a
                class-based, object-oriented programming language and is designed to have as few implementation
                dependencies as possible. A general-purpose programming language made for developers to write once run
                anywhere that is compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java. Java applications are
                compiled to byte code that can run on any Java Virtual Machine.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Python was developed in 1991 by Guido van Rossum. It is a widely used
                general-purpose, high-level programming language. It was designed with an emphasis on code readability,
                and its syntax allows programmers to express their concepts in fewer lines of code. Python is an
                open-source (free) programming language that is used in web programming, data science, artificial
                intelligence, and many scientific applications. <br><br>Python is a dynamic, interpreted
                (bytecode-compiled) language. There are no type declarations of variables, parameters, functions, or
                methods in source code. This makes the code short and flexible, and you lose the compile-time type
                checking of the source code. <br><br>Python tracks the types of all values at runtime and flags code
                that does not make sense as it runs. It is widely used in data science, machine learning, and artificial
                intelligence due to its simplicity and powerful libraries. Programs of python can be developed and
                executed on multiple operating system platforms.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for
                documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML
                pages. HTML constructs images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the
                rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for
                text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. <br><br>Cascading Style Sheets
                (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup
                language. CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout,
                colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and
                control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share
                formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and
                repetition in the structural content. <br><br>JavaScript (JS) is a programming language often
                abbreviated as JS, is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. JavaScript is a high-level,
                often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. It has dynamic typing,
                prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting
                event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces
                (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document
                Object Model (DOM).
